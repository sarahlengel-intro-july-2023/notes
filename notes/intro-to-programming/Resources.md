## Scott Hanselman's "Computer Stuff they Didn't Teach You"
- [Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr)
- Highlights:
	- The git stuff, especially the rebase stuff, I've watched DOZENS of times. I always forget that stuff.
	- Git basics is great, too.
	- The command line stuff 
		- This is REQUIRED viewing if you are lost at the command prompt already, and really recommended even if you aren't
			- [How do you use the Command line? PowerShell, cmd, bash? - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #13 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKBcHuA3VJE&list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr&index=15)
